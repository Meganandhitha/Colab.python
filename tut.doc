1.write a program that generates a stream of random numbers and writes them to a file. 

import random 
count=25 
with open(‘random.txt’,’w’) as file:    
        for i in range(count): 
        res=file.write(f”{random.randint(1,100)}\n”)         
        print(res) 

OUTPUT:
3
3
3
3
3
3
3
3
3
3
2
3

2.write a program to read the random numbers from the file created above and calculate their average 

with open(“random.txt”,’r’) as file:   
            numbers=[float(line.strip()) for line in file]    
            average=sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
            print(f”average: {average}”)

OUTPUT:
average: 45.6

3.write a program that reads from a file and handles the case where the file does not exist. 

try:
    with open(“example.txt”, ‘r’) as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(“Error: The file ‘example.txt’ was not found.”)

OUTPUT:
ERROR!
Error: The file ‘example.txt’ was not found.

4.create a user-defined exception negativenumbererror that is raised when a negative number is encountered in a list. 

def NegativeNumberError(number):
    try:
        for number in numbers:
            if number>0:
                print(“ok”)
    except:
        print(“error: negative number encountered”)
number=[2,8,3,7]
num=NegativeNumberError(number)

OUTPUT:
Error: negative number encountered

5.create a numpy array of 10 random numbers and print them. 

import numpy as np 
arr=np.random.randint(1,101,size=10) 
print(arr) 

OUTPUT:
[15  4  7 14 94 64 45 17 79 25]

6.write a program to add and remove items from a numpy array. 

import numpy as np
array=np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) 
print(“original array:”,array) array1=np.append(array,6)
print(“array after adding and  item:”,array1) array2=np.delete(array,np.where(array==3)) 
print(“array after removing an item:”,array) 

OUTPUT:
Original array: [1 2 3 4 5]
Array after adding an item: [1 2 3 4 5 6]
Array after removing an item: [1 2 3 4 5]

7.sort the numpy array which you created. 

import numpy as np 
arr=np.array([1,3,8,2,9])
arey=np.sort(arr) 
print(“sorted array:”,arey) 

OUTPUT:
Sorted array: [1 2 3 8 9]

8.reshape a numpy array into a 2x5 matrix. 

import numpy as np 
arr=np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]) 
mat=arr.reshape(2,5) 
print(“reshaped array (2x5):”) 
print(mat) 

OUTPUT:
Reshaped array (2x5):
[[ 1  2  3  4  5]
[ 6  7  8  9 10]]

9.demonstrate indexing and slicing on the reshaped matrix.

import numpy as np 
arr=np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]) mat=arr.reshape(2,5)
print(“reshaped array (2x5):”) 
print(mat) 
print(“element at row=1,col=2: “,mat[0,1]) 
print(“first row:”,mat[0]) 
print(“first two columns:”) 
print(mat[:,:2]) 

OUTPUT:
Reshaped array (2x5):
[[ 1  2  3  4  5]
[ 6  7  8  9 10]]
Element at row=1,col=2:  2
First row: [1 2 3 4 5]
First two columns:
[[1 2]
[6 7]]

10.write a program to append new data to an existing file and then read the updated file. 

with open(‘random.txt’,’a’) as file:
           file.write(“101\n”) 
           file.write(“Updated succesfully.\n”) 
with open(‘random.txt’,’r’) as file:             
           up=file.read()    
           print(“Updated file content:”)    
           print(up) 

OUTPUT:
Updated file content:
101
Updated successfully.
